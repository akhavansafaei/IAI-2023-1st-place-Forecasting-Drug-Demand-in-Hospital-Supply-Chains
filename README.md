## 🎯 Problem Statement

The challenge was to forecast drug consumption for:
- **12 individual hospitals** in Hamedan province
- **Time period**: January 1, 2023 - October 30, 2023 (303 days)
- **Outputs required**:
  - Daily consumption for each hospital separately
  - Daily total consumption across all hospitals
  - Monthly total consumption across all hospitals

## 💡 Solution Overview

Our winning solution leverages a sophisticated ensemble of deep learning models with the following key innovations:

1. **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Combination of 4 different models per hospital with custom weights
2. **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Persian calendar features, weather data, COVID-19 impact, seasonal patterns
3. **Recursive Prediction Strategy**: Handles missing data by recursively predicting intermediate values
4. **Hospital-Specific Optimization**: Each hospital has its own trained models with custom ensemble weights

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Model Types

#### **Model 1** (LSTM-based with Dual Sequences)
- **Inputs**:
  - Sequence 1: Last 30 days from current year (15 features)
  - Sequence 2: Last 30 days from previous year (15 features)
  - Last year's consumption on same date
  - Last month's consumption on same date
  - Last week's consumption on same date
- **Architecture**:
  - BiLSTM layers for temporal sequences
  - Dense layers for scalar features
  - Feature concatenation and fusion
  - Output: Single value (predicted consumption)
- **Variants**: Best checkpoint + Last epoch checkpoint

#### **Model 4** (BiLSTM without Drug Feature)
- **Inputs**:
  - Sequence: Last 28 days (14 features, excluding drug consumption)
- **Architecture**:
  - BiLSTM layers for sequence processing
  - Dense layers for prediction
  - Output: Single value (predicted consumption)
- **Variants**: Best checkpoint + Last epoch checkpoint

### Ensemble Strategy

Each hospital uses a weighted ensemble of 4 models:
```
Final_Prediction = (Model_1_best × W1) + (Model_1_last × W2) + (Model_4_best × W3) + (Model_4_last × W4)
```

Custom weights per hospital (example for Hospital 1):
- Model_1 (best): 0.45
- Model_1 (last epoch): 0.30
- Model_4 (best): 0.10
- Model_4 (last epoch): 0.15
